The project is made in IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.5 using JDK 7u79.
The program is tested to run on Ubuntu 14.04

Compilation and running instructions:

1.  Before compiling and running the program you have to create 2 directories
    in your computer. One is "fingertables" another is "files". The directories hold
    the value the finger tables and files belonging to a particular node respectively.

2.  Open the file src/com/cs425/Main.java and change 2 variables to point at the
    directories you just created:

    static String FINGER_TABLE_DIRECTORY = "/home/your/custom/path/fingertables/";
    static String FILE_DIRECTORY = "/home/your/custom/path/files/";

3.  To compile go to the root directory of project and run

    javac -classpath ./lib/*.jar ./src/*/*/*.java -d build

    All the compiled classes will come in build folder.

4.  To run:

    java -cp lib/gson-2.4.jar:build:*/*/*.class com.cs425.Main

    Read the next step before giving any input to the program

5.  After running a prompt comes. The first command to be executed is the "l" or "j" command.
    Please refer to project report for the description of these command.

    Particularly if you are the first node that is joining the network you have to give the command
    "j 12345". The port 12345 has to be the first port which joins a fresh network otherwise the
    program won't work.

6.  After the node 12345 has joined the network you can now join any non-privileged node.
    Joining of new node has to be done through a different instance of the program.

7.  You are now ready to run any of the file system command as mentioned in the report.

8.  Currently the size of the network is fixed to 64 nodes maximum. This is so that the files
    generated by the programs remain understandable to humans. You can change the maximum size
    by changing the following variables in /src/com/cs425/Main.java:

    static int N = 64;
    static int logN = 6;

    Of course you will have to recompile the source code

9.  If at any point of time you want to delete the current network and start afresh you should do
    the following:
    i.  First of all close all the instances of the program.
    ii. Delete all the contents of the two directories you created in step 2.
